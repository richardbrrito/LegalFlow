AI Driven Defense Application
This application is a web-based interface that uses AI to generate summaries and provide defense strategies. It's built with HTML and JavaScript, and uses an AI model from OpenAI's GPT-3.

Features
AI Generated Summary: The application takes user input and sends it to an AI model, which generates a concise summary. This feature is useful for quickly understanding the main points of a large amount of text.

AI Driven Defense: The application uses AI algorithms to suggest defense strategies. This feature can help users make informed decisions about their case.

How It Works
The application has a simple user interface with an input field and a submit button. When the user enters text into the input field and clicks the submit button, the application sends a POST request to the /api/completion endpoint on the server. The request includes the user's input as a JSON payload.

The server handles this request by sending the user's input to an AI model, which generates a summary or defense strategy. The server then sends this generated text back to the client, where it's displayed on the webpage.

Code Overview
The main part of the application is the getCompletion function, which is defined in a <script> tag in the HTML document. This function is attached to the submit button's onclick event, so it's called whenever the user clicks the button.

The getCompletion function does the following:

It gets the user's input from the input field.
It sends a POST request to the /api/completion endpoint on the server, including the user's input in the request body.
It waits for the server to respond with the generated text.
It displays the generated text on the webpage.
If there's an error at any point in this process, the getCompletion function catches the error and logs it to the console.

Usage
To use the application, simply enter your text into the input field and click the submit button. The application will send your text to the AI model and display the generated summary or defense strategy on the webpage.
